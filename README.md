<h2> Hi there! :wave: I am Ahmad Chata</h2>

## Global

## Hooks

- Currently reading — Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript.
- Currently learning — NodeJS and TypeScript (I'll become an outlier if I don't know them).
- If you tweet often, I'm on Twitter as `@ahmadchata` and if you'd like to make things official then email me at `ahmadchata@gmail.com`.

## Components

- Tailwind
