<h2> Hi there! I am Ahmad Chata and I am a Full-Stack Developer :wave:</h2>

## Global

I am currently working at [The Nigerian Army](https://army.mil.ng) Cyber Warfare Command and No! I don't stop missiles. I build, maintain and improve the performance of web apps. I was previously at a startup [Insurpass](https://insurpass.com) as a front-end developer, I built and maintained the company's merchant and admin dashboards that had thousands of users. It might not be much but...pheww!!!

## Hooks

- Currently reading — Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript.
- Currently learning — NodeJS and TypeScript (I'll become an outlier if I don't know them).
- If you tweet often, I'm on Twitter as `@ahmadchata` and if you'd like to make things official then `ahmadchata@gmail.com`.

## Components

- PostgreSQL
- Rails
- Ruby
- Good ol' Bootstrap
- React (NextJS because it's emperically better)
- NodeJS
- TypeScript (It's imperative these days)
- Tailwind
